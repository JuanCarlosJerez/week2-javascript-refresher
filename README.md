# Week 2 Refresher Lecture

### Today we will be building 3 small projects. But before we can do so we need to set up our environments.

## Setup:
1. Change directory ```cd``` into your wyncode folder.
2. Create a new directory and name it ```week2-refresher```
3. Fork the following repository ```https://github.com/dankified/week2-javascript-refresher.git``` in order to fork visit the link and click on the fork button on the top right corner. This will create a copy of this repository on your github account. 
4. Clone your own version of ```week2-javascript-refresher``` into the directory you created in step 2.
5. Run the following command in your terminal ```npm install```. This command will install this project's dependencies. Dependencies are other programs on which your program relies in order to work. We will talk more about this next week. This operation might take a couple of minutes.
6. Run ```npm run test``` in your console. This will initialize a test suite that will check if your code is working correctly. We will talk more about testing on another lecture.
7. Go to the **\_\_test__** directory and remove the first character from line 10. Line 10 should look like this ```describe('square of a number', () => {```. Save your changes and you will now see that you have some failing tests.
8. Open the ```square.js``` file and start coding!
9. After all tests pass, remove the initial 'x' from line 23 and open ```replaceCharactersInString.js.```
10. After all tests pass remove the initial 'x' from line 32  and open ```bmiCalculator.js```

## Have fun!!
