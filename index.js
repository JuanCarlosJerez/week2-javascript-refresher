//1-Function that takes 1 parameter and calculates the square of the argument. 
//If the argument passed to the function is not of type 'number' coerce it to be a number.
//If the result of the coercion is not a valid numeric value return null.
//Hint: isNaN is a function that when passed a value it will return true if that value is not a number.

function square(num) {

}

//2-Function that takes 3 parameters, all of them strings. 
//The first argument should be a multi character string (more than one character string). 
//The second and third arguments are single character strings.
//This function should return a string that has all instances of the second parameter replaced with the third.
//e.g: replaceCharactersInString('somethings', 's', 'p') returns pomethingp.
